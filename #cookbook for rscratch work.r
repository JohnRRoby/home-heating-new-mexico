# Here's a map of the primary home heating source by county in New Mexico. It's intentionally simple and static, using just the usmap package.

# This uses one ACS table: B25040, house heating fuel, and the ACS 5-year estimates for 2016, the single estimate, not including margin of error.  

# This begins with a .csv file. I previously cleaned the table in LibreOffice by removing some extraneous columns, trimming the county names, fixing spelling of Do√±a Ana County and renaming the file for clarity. Your workflow will vary.
